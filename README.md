# Other Traversing methods Challenge 2

When a table header is clicked, the corresponding row should highlight. 
When another table header (on the row) is clicked, the corresponding row 
should highlight, and all others should turn white. 
Add extra rows if you need to. Traverse the DOM to find a solution.

Struggling when I accidentally used children after using (this) instead of siblings. Problem solved and functional now.
